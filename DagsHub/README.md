# DagsHub
Remote repository used to track data with Git and DVC. Dagshub integrates easily with MLOps stacks like Kaggle, Pandas, Github, aws, kubeflow, pytorch and many more.</br>


### Use cases:
- Dataset Management and Versioning
- Experiment Tracking
- Annotating data
- Model Registry & Deployment

### Difference b/w GitHub and DagsHub
With Github we can only maintain the versioning of our code but with Dagshub we can upload data to Dagshub (DVC), track code and Loge experiments with MLFlow. We can run MLFlow server over a Dagshub account.
